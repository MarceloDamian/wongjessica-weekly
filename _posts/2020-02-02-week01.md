###### Week of January 27th, 2020 - February 7th, 2020 
This is the first week of classes for the Spring 2020 semester. To be honest, prior to the start of the semester, I felt extremely exhausted. I was simply not ready to start the semester. But now, I feel pretty good about everything. I now feel a lot better than I was before. Let me explain why:

For one thing, I think the two class sessions I took this week for my Open-Source Software Development Class (OSSD) have gotten me pretty excited. This is because learning about the history behind Open Source Software was quite interesting. Prior to the class, I thought open source contributions were fascinating, and I was a full supporter of open source software and contributions. But now that I have learned more about what it really is, and what it really means, I am still a full supporter, but on a whole new level of "support". It reminded me about why I chose to take this class. So, _**why did I choose to take this class?**_ Well, there are many reasons as to why I'm taking this class right now.
