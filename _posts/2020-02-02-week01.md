# Week of January 27th, 2020 - February 7th, 2020 
This is the first week of classes for the Spring 2020 semester. To be honest, prior to the start of the semester, I felt extremely exhausted. I was simply not ready to start the semester. But now, I feel pretty good about everything. I now feel a lot better than I was before.
