###### Week of February 3rd, 2020 - February 9th, 2020 
Honestly speaking, whenever OSSD class ends, I always feel a rush of motivation to keep going further than what the class left off at. On Monday, February 3rd, I was introduced to add-on development, specifically for the Firefox browser. I have always wanted to create an extension, but I've always shied away from doing so, since it seemed pretty intimidating. After class ended that day, I felt a lot more confident about it, and was pretty excited to get more hands on experience with extension development. However, this feeling of excitement died down when I was faced with the reality that I had to finish my priorities from other classes before I could even touch add-on development again. The same happened with Thursday's class session, where the class ended off at FOSS project searching. During class, I found huge lists of possible open source video games and web applications I could contribute to, and got a huge rush of excitement from browsing through them. Like, *who knew GIMP was open source*? After class, I immediately made a SourceForge account and started browsing through open source softwares, conveniently running into familiar title names. Again, this rush of excitement died down when I was met with other class obligations soon after. 

Though other classwork took up the majority of my time, I still indiscriminately sought out open source projects to work on. I am currently in a Google mentoring program set up by the Daedalus Honors program, where three computer science honors students get paired with a mentor from Google. This week my mentor, Kristen, introduced us mentees to 3 software engineers at Google, whom we learned a lot about. One of the software engineers we met worked on open source software at Google, specifically their bundle of [material components](https://github.com/material-components) designs. The engineer, Laticia, showed us a quick demo and I thought it was super cool and exciting! I told her about the OSSD course I was taking, and she welcomed me to contribute to the project on GitHub. I will definitely take this into consideration when considering open source contributions to work on.

With this being said, I _**can't wait**_ to make open source contributions throughout this semester. I know I'm speaking big ideas right now, with no real pragmatic route so far, but hear me out. These are some ways I want to contribute:

- For one thing, I am already an avid contributor for Google Maps, but I always grew impatient with waiting for my changes to get approved. So, I already jumped the gun a little bit, but I was curious on trying out OpenStreetMaps while I was sitting in a Hawaiian-themed restaurant in Brooklyn, just finishing up my Computer Architecture homework. So, I pulled up the website, and filled in the details of the establishment I was sitting right in. Details about the contribution can be found in the contributions tab [here](https://hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020.github.io/wongjessica-weekly/contributions/). My point is, I found it _amazing_ that my changes were in effect right when I clicked save,they were published in _real time_. It felt nice to make a direct impact, and I can't wait to make more contributions to OpenStreetMaps! The entire block I was on was empty, so I will definitely go back one day to fill the rest in.

- As aforementioned, I already found a ton of possible open source projects I'd love to contribute to!

Let's be real, the **satisfaction** we get from contributing to something and, thus, making an **impact** feels so great. But of course, there are other benefits to consider.
- FOSS Benefits to Your Skills 
- FOSS Benefits to Your Career
I saw open source contributions on someone's resume.

- Benefits from Preparation
