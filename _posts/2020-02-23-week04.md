###### Week of February 17th, 2020 - February 23rd, 2020 
As I already mentioned in my previous blogs, I have been actively searching for open source contributions this entire time, which you can find on this list. I have also added some more projects I've considered from my professor's "Project Suggestions" list. Here, I will sort these projects by which seem the most appealing for me to work on.

**Projects I've looked at**
- [The Top 19 Tetris Open Source Projects](https://awesomeopensource.com/projects/tetris), more specifically:
    - [tetris - A terminal interface for Tetris](https://github.com/samtay/tetris)
    - [Flatris](https://github.com/skidding/flatris)
- []()

**Projects I've eliminated**
- [tetris - A terminal interface for Tetris](https://github.com/samtay/tetris) 
    - Very inactive GitHub repository, last update was 7 months ago. Also has 0 issues, 0 pull requests, and 3 contributors.

**Projects that are candidates**

I also submitted a pull request for [Keisuke's blog](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020/Ks5810-weekly) fixing some of his typos!
