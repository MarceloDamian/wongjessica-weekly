My name is Jessica Wong and I aspire to be a software engineer, specializing in full-stack development. My dream is to create software that impacts the world. In my free time, I like to code, drink hot chocolate, play video games, and watch anime.


I first found my love for computer science in middle school, where I grew a passion for coding through creating websites via blogs. I self taught myself HTML and CSS, and was then able to implement unique designs and features that showcased who I was. From just a simple webframe, I was able to customize a theme for a blog's webpage, that, subjectively, looked great. From then on, I knew that I wanted to be a programmer in the future. In high school, I joined the Computer Science Club and eventually became president. There, I taught my peers how to build computers, and also taught them basic website development with HTML and CSS. I also joined the Robotics Team, where I built robots and programmed them with Java and Android Studio, and competed in the First Tech Challenge (FTC) competition. I loved coding and technology, and then went on to study computer science in college. And here I am now, very happy with where I ended up. I hope to work on new and amazing innovative projects in the future and use my skills and technology to accomplish something incredible!
