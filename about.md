My name is Jessica Wong and I aspire to be a software engineer, specializing in full-stack development. My dream is to create software that impacts the world. In my free time, I like to code, drink hot chocolate, play video games, and watch anime.


I first found my love for computer science in middle school, where I grew a passion for coding through creating websites via blogs. I self taught myself HTML and CSS, and was then able to implement unique designs and features that showcased who I was. From just a simple webframe, I was able to customize a theme for a blog, that, subjectively, looked great.
